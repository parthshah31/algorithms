Topics:

Insertion Sort:
-> Take values in sequence and 1 by 1 put them in their proper spot by swapping.

Analysis:
-> Assume RAM Model. Count number of instructions. User asymptotic notation instead of exact. Worst case analysis is generally what is used, however there are other analyses.

Designing Algorithms:
-> Many paradigms such as Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, etc

Merge Sort:
-> Divide and Conquer solution for sorting. Split into halves, sort halves, then combine halves.

Algorithms:
-> insertion sort
-> merge sort
